## Photograph-Object-Recognition-Dataset

The problem of automatically identifying objects in photographs is di!cult because of the near infinite number of permutations of objects, positions, lighting and so on. It’s a really hard problem. This is a well studied problem in computer vision and more recently an important demonstration of the capability of deep learning. A standard computer vision and deep learning dataset for this problem was developed by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR).
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 photos divided into 10 classes (hence the name CIFAR-10)1. Classes include common objects such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats and so on. The dataset is split in a standard way, where 50,000 images are used for training a model and the remaining 10,000 for evaluating its performance. The photos are in color with red, green and blue channels, but are small measuring 32 ⇥ 32 pixel squares.

State-of-the-art results can be achieved using very large convolutional neural networks. One can learn about state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 on Rodrigo Benenson’s webpage2. Model performance is reported in classification accuracy, with very good performance above 90% with human performance on the problem at 94% and state-of-the-art results at 96% at the time of writing
